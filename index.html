  <h2>As you can see, I am experimenting a little given that I now have this opportunity</h2>
  <h3>And testing the limits of what i can do with this</h3>
  <p>It's pretty fun being able to modify all parts of this website, such as changing the colours as you can likely see</p>
  <p>How about a photo of a dog?</p>
