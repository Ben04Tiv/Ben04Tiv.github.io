  <h1>My name is Ben</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
  <h2>Now this is my first attempt at fully making my own website</h2>

  <h2>As you can see, I am experimenting a little given that I now have this opportunity</h2>
  <h3>And testing the limits of what i can do with this</h3>
  <p>It's pretty fun being able to modify all parts of this website, such as changing the colours as you can likely see</p>
  <p>How about a photo of a dog?</p>

  <h1>Now, to talk about one of my favourite hobbies</h1>
  <img class ="resize" src="https://logos-world.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DnD-Symbol.png" alt = "DnD logo" />
  <h3>There are a few things to keep in mind while playing DnD</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Have fun</li>
    <li>Be respectful</li>
    <li>Less of a rule, but feel free to experiment with anything you do in the game!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I enjoy playing it for a multitude of reasons, the technical aspect of using maths within the game, the aspect of chance with rolling the dice to determine many things, the storys... everything!</p>
  <h4>So, how about i explain a bit of how it plays? Though firstly, here is a link to a great page to do with dnd.</h4>
  <p><a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/">The second best website for dnd!</a></p>
  <h5>As you might tell, its a website that holds all the information regarding dnd, including all the races, classes and spells of the game that someone might need to know, especially if you do not own any of the books or do not have one of them with you at the time</h5>
