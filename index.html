  <h1>My name is Ben</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
  <h2>Now this is my first attempt at fully making my own website</h2>

  <h2>As you can see, I am experimenting a little given that I now have this opportunity</h2>
  <h3>And testing the limits of what i can do with this</h3>
  <p>It's pretty fun being able to modify all parts of this website, such as changing the colours as you can likely see</p>
  <p>How about a photo of a dog?</p>

  <h3>There are a few things to keep in mind while playing DnD</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Have fun</li>
    <li>Be respectful</li>
    <li>Less of a rule, but feel free to experiment with anything you do in the game!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I enjoy playing it for a multitude of reasons, the technical aspect of using maths within the game, the aspect of chance with rolling the dice to determine many things, the storys... everything!</p>
  <h4>So, how about i explain a bit of how it plays? Though firstly, here is a link to a great page to do with dnd.</h4>
  <div>
  <p><a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/">The second best website for dnd!</a></p>
  </div>
  <p>The first one being DndBeyond</p>
  <h5>As you might tell, its a website that holds all the information regarding dnd, including all the races, classes and spells of the game that someone might need to know, especially if you do not own any of the books or do not have one of them with you at the time</h5>
  <p>And its a website i do use a whole lot when i do not have the books by my side, and it has been helping me whenever i have needed to think up of new characters, or even just learning more about dnd in general</p>
  <h3>Speaking of, when making a character in dnd, you should follow this order:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>First you should decide on your class. This is the most important as it effectively determines how you will play in combat and also outside of it</li>
    <li>Secondly is choosing your race/ species. Each race is unique with different things it can effect. while some races tend to be known for being certain classes, do not let that stop you from making the choice you want</li>
    <li>Next is then choosing your ability scores for your character. These can be done using the standard array, which are a set collection of numbers, or you can roll your stats which can add for more variation. Classes always have one or two stats they would prefer to have the highest number, so bear that in mind</li>
    <li>Additionally, decide on a background for your character, though this can be done after creating a backstory, or done before to give you something to help with making your backstory. Each background can help give certain proficiences</li>
    <li>Also, decide on how your character looks! Make them as unique as you want (While of course sticking to the appearance of the race you have chosen)</li>
    <li>And lastly, make a backstory! I find having one for your character makes you rather invested in their story. Make sure that it does fit in with the class you have chosen, but other than that, feel free to include details that you like, make them unique!</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>That is what you need to know in more simple terms, but if you're starting off then I am sure that the dungeon master you'll have will assist with all of those, except for the backstory at least, though they are obliged to tell you about the world in which your backstory will take place</h3>
  <h4>Now regarding campaigns themselves, you can do an official module, published by those who do the other dnd books. These include:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Phandelver and below: The shattered obelisk</li>
    <li>Baldur's gate: Descent into Avernus</li>
    <li>Dungeon of the mad mage</li>
    <li>And many others!</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>However you can also do your own or someone else's campaign that they have made themselves. These are generally called homebrew as they are not official and are made at home and can be a mix of official and made up parts</h4>
  <h4>As of right now, i am a player in an offical campaign, but also a player in a homebrew campaign, both of which are very fun despite their differences, and also allow me to play as different types of characters, be it a different race, class, personality and backstory! in my opinion, it will be hard to get tired of playing</h4>
  <h3>Not sure if you can tell, but Dnd is certainly one of my favourite hobbies to both play and watch</h3>
